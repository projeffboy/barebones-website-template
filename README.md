# Barebones Website Template

This is a one page website template, with just 3 files and no folders for you to maintain. There's no node modules, no Gulp, no webpack, no React, and there's no Pug or SASS.

The 3 files here are...
-index.html: the necessary tags are already in here
-style.css: contains some selectors to get you started and CSS reset
-script.js: nothing in here - you can even delete this file if your site does not require Javascript

If you need to use external libraries like jQuery, just manually install it or use a CDN and link it to index.html.
